# CMPT 417 Final Project
### Spring 2020

##### Jeffrey Yamasaki, Marko Miletic, and Adam Bignell

In this project we implement and test ICTS and EPEA*, and compare the algorithms in both typical and pathological search spaces.

Our solution is built on top of the skeleton code provided in the assignment *Model AI Assignments 2020: A Project on Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)* by Wolfgang HÃ¶nig, Jiaoyang Li, and Sven Koenig of the University of Southern California.
